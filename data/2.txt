I don’t see a invasion. I live my life. Sure, the more south you get the more Hispanics you see. But most people are just trying to get by. I don’t see a “drain on society” or someone stealing my job.

I know people cross illegally, but I dont understand why someone in North Dakota should care that much.

if a 22 year old crosses to wash dishes in El Paso for 3 dollars an hour how does that effect the “build the wall” people of Wyoming?

My little understanding is that a lot of Americans think that these border crossers automatically get super nice lifestyles on fed tax money. Or they are all drug dealers. Which I don’t think is mostly true but I truly don’t know.

Edit: good lord. I did not think this would blow up to a lot of infighting. That’s my fault. I should’ve known people have strong opinions on this topic and love fighting on Reddit.

Thanks did the helpful responses. I wish you all a Merry Christmas.
